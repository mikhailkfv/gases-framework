Version 1.2.3 (Bugfix/Patch)

Changes:
- Added the cohesion property to dictate how gas behaves when it's 0-density. Higher cohesion means there will be more gas needed before the gas will expand in midair. 

Bugfixes:
- Fixed getGasType returning null instead of GasTypeAir.
- Fixed ignited gas not spreading and disappearing properly.
- Increased world generation weight to ensure gas pockets were not being popped by other generators.
- Fix configurations creating error messages for string arrays.
